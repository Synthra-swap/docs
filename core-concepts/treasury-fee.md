# Treasury Fee System

The Treasury Fee is Synthra's revolutionary mechanism that creates sustainable protocol revenue while maintaining competitive returns for liquidity providers. This system represents a fundamental innovation in DEX economics.

## Overview

Unlike traditional AMMs where 100% of trading fees go to liquidity providers, Synthra implements a **67/33 split** where:

- **67% goes to Liquidity Providers** - Maintaining competitive yields
- **33% goes to Protocol Treasury** - Funding sustainable growth

This creates the first self-sustaining DEX economy that doesn't rely on token emissions or external funding for operations and development.ury Fee

The Treasury Fee is a unique feature of Synthra that distinguishes it from other decentralized exchanges. This page explains how the treasury fee works, its purpose, and the benefits it brings to the Synthra ecosystem.

## What is the Treasury Fee?

Unlike standard pool fees that go to liquidity providers, the treasury fee is directed to the protocol’s treasury, providing a consistent income stream in external tokens. While many protocols are forced to sell their own token — creating downward pressure on its price — just to keep the platform running, our model ensures sustainable funding for development and buybacks without relying on native token sales.

## How the Treasury Fee Works

### Automatic Fee Distribution

The treasury fee operates seamlessly within every trade:

1. **User initiates swap** on any fee tier pool
2. **Total fee calculated** based on pool tier (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, or 1%)
3. **Automatic split executed**:
   - 67% allocated to active liquidity providers
   - 33% transferred to protocol treasury
4. **Transaction completes** with full transparency

### Mathematical Breakdown

**Example: $10,000 USDC → ETH swap on 0.3% fee tier**

```
Total Trading Fee: $10,000 × 0.3% = $30 USDC

Distribution:
• Liquidity Providers: $30 × 67% = $20.10 USDC  
• Protocol Treasury: $30 × 33% = $9.90 USDC

Effective Rates:
• LP Rate: 0.201% of swap volume
• Treasury Rate: 0.099% of swap volume
```

**No Additional Cost to Traders**: The fee split happens within existing fee structures, so traders pay the same total fees as any comparable DEX.
