# Treasury Fee

The Treasury Fee is a unique feature of Synthra that distinguishes it from other decentralized exchanges. This page explains how the treasury fee works, its purpose, and the benefits it brings to the Synthra ecosystem.

## What is the Treasury Fee?

Unlike standard pool fees that go to liquidity providers, the treasury fee is directed to the protocol’s treasury, providing a consistent income stream in external tokens. While many protocols are forced to sell their own token — creating downward pressure on its price — just to keep the platform running, our model ensures sustainable funding for development and buybacks without relying on native token sales.

## How the Treasury Fee Works

### Fee Calculation

The treasury fee is calculated as 0.1% of the input amount of the swap. For example:

* If you swap 1,000 USDC, the treasury fee would be 1 USDC
* If you swap 10 ETH, the treasury fee would be 0.01 ETH

### Treasury Management

The collected fees are automatically sent to the Synthra Treasury, which is a multi-signature wallet. This ensures that treasury funds are managed securely and transparently.

## Purpose of the Treasury Fee

The treasury fee serves several critical purposes in the Synthra ecosystem:

### 1. Funding Token Buybacks

The primary use of treasury funds is to buy back Synthra tokens from the open market. These buybacks:

* Create consistent buying pressure for the token
* Reduce the circulating supply if tokens are burned
* Provide value accrual for token holders

### 2. Protocol Development

A portion of the treasury funds may be allocated to:

* Core protocol development
* Security audits
* Bug bounties
* Infrastructure costs

### 3. Ecosystem Growth

Treasury funds can also support:

* Grants for developers building on Synthra
* Liquidity mining programs
* Marketing and community initiatives
* Integration partnerships

## Buyback Mechanism

The buyback mechanism is a key component of Synthra's tokenomics:

### Buyback Schedule

Buybacks occur on a regular schedule, typically:

* Weekly small buybacks for consistent pressure
* Monthly larger buybacks announced to the community
* Special buybacks during significant market events

### Buyback Execution

Buybacks are executed through:

1. Direct market purchases on Synthra itself
2. Batch processing to optimize gas costs

### Token Destination

Tokens acquired through buybacks may be:

* Burned (permanently removed from circulation)
* Held in the treasury for future use
* Distributed to stakers as additional rewards

## Treasury Fee vs. Other Models

The treasury fee model offers several advantages over alternative funding models:

### Compared to Inflation

Many protocols rely on token inflation to fund development, which dilutes existing holders. Synthra's treasury fee:

* Does not dilute token holders
* Creates buying pressure rather than selling pressure
* Scales with protocol usage

### Compared to One-time Funding

Unlike protocols funded by one-time token sales or venture capital:

* Treasury fee provides ongoing, sustainable funding
* Revenue scales with protocol success
* Aligns incentives between users and token holders

## Treasury Transparency

Synthra is committed to transparency in treasury management:

* All treasury addresses are public
* Regular reports on treasury holdings and activities
* Community oversight through governance
* Clear guidelines for fund allocation

## Treasury Fee Economics

The treasury fee creates a virtuous cycle for the Synthra ecosystem:

1. More trading volume → More fees collected
2. More fees collected → More buybacks
3. More buybacks → Higher token value
4. Higher token value → More interest in the protocol
5. More interest → More trading volume

This alignment of incentives helps ensure the long-term sustainability of the protocol.



## Future Developments

Potential future developments for the treasury fee mechanism include:

* Dynamic fee adjustment based on market conditions
* Additional use cases for treasury funds
* Integration with other DeFi protocols for treasury management
* Enhanced transparency and reporting tools
