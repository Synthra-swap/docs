# Governance

Governance is a critical component of the Synthra protocol, enabling community-driven decision making and protocol evolution. This page explains how governance works in Synthra and how token holders can participate in shaping the future of the protocol.

## Governance Overview

Synthra governance allows token holders to propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol. These changes can include:

* Protocol parameter adjustments
* Treasury fund allocations
* Smart contract upgrades
* Integration with other protocols
* Fee structure modifications

## The Synthra Token

The Synthra token (SYNTH) is the governance token of the protocol. Holding SYNTH grants voting rights proportional to the amount held. The token serves several purposes:

* Voting on governance proposals
* Delegating voting power to other addresses
* Signaling community priorities
* Potentially receiving protocol revenue (subject to governance decisions)

## Governance Process

The Synthra governance process follows a structured workflow:

### 1. Discussion Phase

Before formal proposals, ideas are discussed in:

* The Synthra forum
* Discord governance channels
* Community calls

This allows for refinement of ideas and building community consensus.

### 2. Proposal Creation

To create a formal proposal, a community member must:

* Hold or be delegated a minimum threshold of SYNTH tokens
* Submit a detailed proposal following the standard template
* Include specific executable actions if technical changes are required

### 3. Voting Period

Once a proposal is submitted:

* A 3-day voting period begins
* Token holders can vote For, Against, or Abstain
* Votes are weighted by the voter's SYNTH balance
* Voting power can be delegated to another address

### 4. Execution

If a proposal passes (more For votes than Against, and meeting quorum requirements):

* A 2-day timelock period begins for security
* After the timelock, the proposal can be executed
* Technical changes are implemented automatically through the governance contract
* Non-technical decisions are carried out by the core team or relevant working groups

## Delegation

Token holders can delegate their voting power to other addresses without transferring their tokens. This allows:

* Community members to support trusted experts
* Protocol users to participate in governance without actively voting
* Formation of delegate coalitions around shared values

To delegate voting power:

1. Navigate to the Governance section of the Synthra interface
2. Connect your wallet
3. Enter the address you want to delegate to
4. Confirm the transaction

## Governance Parameters

Current governance parameters include:

* **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum SYNTH required to submit a proposal
* **Quorum**: Minimum participation required for a valid vote
* **Voting Period**: Duration of the voting phase
* **Timelock**: Delay between approval and execution

These parameters can themselves be modified through governance proposals.

## Treasury Governance

A key responsibility of governance is managing the protocol treasury, which receives the 0.1% treasury fee from all swaps. Governance decisions regarding the treasury include:

* Allocation of funds for buybacks
* Development funding
* Ecosystem grants
* Strategic investments

For more details on the treasury, see the [Treasury Fee](treasury-fee.md) page.

## Working Groups

To improve governance efficiency, Synthra has established specialized working groups focused on specific areas:

* **Technical Working Group**: Protocol upgrades and integrations
* **Treasury Working Group**: Financial management and buyback strategy
* **Growth Working Group**: Marketing, partnerships, and user acquisition
* **Community Working Group**: Education, support, and community building

Working groups can make recommendations to the broader governance process but don't have unilateral decision-making authority.

## Governance Tools

Synthra provides several tools to facilitate governance participation:

* **Governance Dashboard**: View and vote on active proposals
* **Delegation Portal**: Delegate or receive voting power
* **Proposal Simulator**: Test the impact of parameter changes
* **Governance Forum**: Discuss ideas and build consensus

## Governance Security

Several mechanisms ensure the security of the governance process:

* **Timelock**: Provides time to respond to malicious proposals
* **Multisig Oversight**: Critical functions have multisig protection
* **Graduated Voting**: Voting power increases with token lock duration
* **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause protocol in case of critical issues

## Future of Synthra Governance

The governance system itself will evolve over time. Potential future developments include:

* On-chain governance for more parameters
* Reputation-based voting systems
* Quadratic voting mechanisms
* Cross-chain governance capabilities

## How to Participate

Anyone can participate in Synthra governance by:

1. **Acquiring SYNTH tokens**: Through exchanges or by providing liquidity
2. **Joining the community**: Forum, Discord, and community calls
3. **Staying informed**: Following proposal discussions and voting
4. **Contributing expertise**: Participating in working groups or technical discussions
5. **Delegating or being delegated**: Participating in the delegation system

## Governance Best Practices

For effective participation in governance:

* Research proposals thoroughly before voting
* Consider long-term protocol health over short-term gains
* Engage in discussion before formal proposals
* Delegate to trusted community members if you can't actively participate
* Focus on data-driven decision making
