## What Makes Synthra Different?

Before diving in, here's what sets Synthra apart:

- **Concentrated Liquidity**: Up to 4000x more capital efficient than traditional AMMs
- **Sustainable Economics**: 67% of fees to LPs, 33% to treasury for buybacks
- **No Token Inflation**: Deflationary tokenomics through regular token burns
- **Deep Liquidity**: Treasury-funded ecosystem growth over time

## Quick Start Checklist

âœ… **Understand fee structure** - know how the 67/33 split works  
âœ… **Make your first swap** to experience the interface  
âœ… **Explore liquidity provision** for earning opportunities  
âœ… **Join the community** for ongoing support  

## Connecting Your Wallet

To start using Synthra, you'll need to connect a compatible Web3 wallet:

1. Visit the [Synthra app](https://app.synthra.org)
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner
3. Select your preferred wallet:
   - **MetaMask** (Most popular browser wallet)
   - **WalletConnect** (Mobile wallet integration)
   - **Coinbase Wallet** (Coinbase's native wallet)
   - **Rainbow**, **Trust Wallet**, and others
4. Approve the connection request in your wallet

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Make sure your wallet is on the correct network before connecting!

## Understanding Synthra's Fee Structure

Before trading, it's important to understand how fees work:

### Fee Tiers
- **0.01%**: Stablecoin pairs (USDC/USDT)
- **0.05%**: Low volatility pairs (ETH/stETH)  
- **0.30%**: Standard pairs (ETH/USDC) - Most common
- **1.00%**: High volatility pairs (new/exotic tokens)

### Fee Distribution (Key Innovation!)
- **67% goes to Liquidity Providers** - Competitive yields
- **33% goes to Protocol Treasury** - Funds buybacks and development

**Example**: On a $1,000 trade with 0.3% fees:
- Total Fee: $3.00
- LP Earnings: $2.01
- Treasury: $0.99 (used for token buybacks)

This unique structure means your trading helps grow the ecosystem while maintaining competitive rates!

## Network Selection

Synthra is available on multiple blockchain networks. To switch networks:

1. Click on the network selector in the top right corner
2. Choose your preferred network from the dropdown menu
3. Approve the network switch in your wallet if prompted

**Supported Networks**:
- **UOMI Finney** (Primary deployment)

ðŸ’° **Gas Fees**: Remember to keep some native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) for transaction fees.

## Making Your First Swap

Swapping tokens on Synthra is straightforward and efficient:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Navigate to the "Swap" tab** in the main interface
2. **Select your input token** - Click the token dropdown in the top field
3. **Enter the amount** you want to swap
4. **Select your output token** - Click the dropdown in the bottom field
5. **Review the trade details**:
   - Exchange rate and price impact
   - Fee breakdown (LP + Treasury split)
   - Minimum output due to slippage
6. **Click "Swap"** and confirm in your wallet

### Understanding the Interface

The swap interface shows important information:

- **Price Impact**: How your trade affects the token price
- **Minimum Received**: Guaranteed minimum due to slippage protection
- **LP Fee**: Amount going to liquidity providers (67%)
- **Treasury Fee**: Amount supporting the ecosystem (33%)
- **Route**: Path your trade takes through different pools

### Smart Routing

Synthra automatically finds the best price across:
- Multiple fee tiers for the same pair
- Multi-hop routes through intermediate tokens
- Optimal pool selection for your trade size

ðŸ’¡ **Best Practices**:
- Start with smaller amounts to learn the interface
- Check price impact for large trades
- Set appropriate slippage tolerance (0.5% for stable pairs, 1-3% for volatile pairs)

## Understanding Slippage

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price. To adjust your slippage tolerance:

1. Click the settings icon in the swap interface
2. Set your preferred slippage tolerance (default is 0.5%)
3. A higher tolerance increases the likelihood of transaction success but may result in less favorable rates
4. A lower tolerance may provide better rates but increases the risk of transaction failure

## Providing Liquidity

Providing liquidity on Synthra allows you to earn fees from trades while supporting the ecosystem. Here's an overview:

### Why Provide Liquidity?

- **Earn 67% of Trading Fees**: Higher returns than traditional AMMs
- **Capital Efficiency**: Concentrated liquidity maximizes earning potential  
- **Flexible Strategies**: Multiple fee tiers and price ranges
- **Support Ecosystem**: Your contribution helps treasury fund growth

### Quick Start Steps

1. Navigate to the "Pool" tab in the main interface
2. Click "New Position"
3. Select the token pair you want to provide liquidity for
4. Choose a fee tier based on expected pair volatility:
   - **0.01%**: Stable pairs (USDC/USDT)
   - **0.05%**: Low volatility pairs (ETH/stETH)
   - **0.30%**: Standard pairs (ETH/USDC) - Most popular
   - **1.00%**: High volatility pairs (new/exotic tokens)
5. Set your price range by defining the minimum and maximum prices
6. Enter the amounts of each token you want to deposit
7. Review your position details and click "Add"
8. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: The narrower your price range, the more concentrated your liquidity will be, potentially earning higher fees when the price stays within that range.
