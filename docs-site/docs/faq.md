## Trading on Synthra

### How do I swap tokens on Synthra?

1. Visit [app.synthra.org](https://app.synthra.org)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select the tokens you want to exchange
4. Enter the amount and review the trade details
5. Click "Swap" and confirm in your wallet

For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

### What are the fees for swapping tokens?

Synthra has different fee tiers with a unique **67/33 split**:

**Fee Tiers:**
* **0.01%** for stable pairs (USDC/USDT)
* **0.05%** for low volatility pairs (ETH/stETH)  
* **0.30%** for standard pairs (ETH/USDC)
* **1.00%** for high volatility pairs

**Fee Distribution:**
* **67% goes to Liquidity Providers** - Competitive yields
* **33% goes to Protocol Treasury** - Funds buybacks and development

**Example**: On a $1,000 trade with 0.3% fees:
- Total fee: $3.00
- LP earnings: $2.01  
- Treasury: $0.99 (used for token buybacks)

### What is slippage and how do I set it?

Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the executed price. You can adjust your slippage tolerance in the settings menu of the swap interface. A higher tolerance increases the likelihood of transaction success but may result in less favorable rates.

### Why did my transaction fail?

Transactions can fail for several reasons:

* Insufficient funds for gas fees
* High price volatility exceeding slippage tolerance
* Network congestion
* Smart contract safety checks

If your transaction fails, try increasing your slippage tolerance or waiting for more stable market conditions.

## Providing Liquidity

### How do I provide liquidity on Synthra?

To provide liquidity, navigate to the Pool tab, click "New Position," select a token pair and fee tier, set your price range, and deposit your tokens. For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

### What is concentrated liquidity?

Concentrated liquidity allows you to provide liquidity within a specific price range, rather than across the entire price spectrum. This means your capital is used more efficiently, potentially generating higher returns. Learn more in our [Concentrated Liquidity](core-concepts/concentrated-liquidity.md) guide.

### How do I earn fees as a liquidity provider?

You earn fees when trades occur through the pool you've provided liquidity to, and when the price is within your specified range. Fees are automatically accumulated and can be collected at any time.

### What is impermanent loss?

Impermanent loss occurs when the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The greater the change, the more significant the impermanent loss. With Synthra's concentrated liquidity, you can potentially reduce impermanent loss by setting strategic price ranges.

### How do I collect my earned fees?

To collect fees, go to the Pool tab, select your position, and click "Collect Fees." The fees will be transferred to your wallet.

## Treasury Fee and Buybacks

### What is the treasury fee?

The treasury fee is a 0.1% fee applied to all swaps on Synthra. This fee is directed to the protocol treasury and is separate from the liquidity provider fees.

### How are treasury funds used?

Treasury funds are primarily used for token buybacks, which help support the value of the Synthra token. Additionally, a portion may be allocated to protocol development, security audits, and ecosystem growth initiatives.
