# Audits

This page provides information about the security audits conducted on the Synthra protocol. Regular third-party security audits are a critical component of Synthra's security strategy, helping to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Audit Process

Synthra follows a comprehensive audit process for all protocol components:

1. **Internal Review**: Thorough code review by the core development team
2. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical verification of critical components
3. **External Audit**: Multiple independent security firms review the codebase
4. **Public Disclosure**: Audit reports published for community review
5. **Remediation**: All findings addressed with appropriate fixes
6. **Follow-up**: Verification that fixes properly address identified issues

## Bug Bounty Program

Synthra maintains an ongoing bug bounty program to incentivize the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities:

* **Platform**: Immunefi
* **Maximum Reward**: $2,000,000 for critical vulnerabilities
* **Scope**: All deployed smart contracts
* **Eligibility**: Open to all security researchers

## Audit Findings Resolution

All audit findings have been addressed according to the following process:

1. **Severity Assessment**: Evaluation of impact and likelihood
2. **Fix Development**: Implementation of appropriate fixes
3. **Peer Review**: Internal review of proposed fixes
4. **Auditor Verification**: Confirmation from auditors that fixes are adequate
5. **Implementation**: Deployment of fixes to production

## Continuous Security Monitoring

Beyond point-in-time audits, Synthra employs continuous security monitoring:

* **Forta Network**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious transactions
* **Tenderly**: Contract monitoring and alerting
* **Internal Dashboards**: Custom monitoring for protocol health metrics

## Future Audit Plans

Synthra is committed to ongoing security reviews:

* Quarterly security assessments
* Audit of all major protocol upgrades
* Specialized audits for new features
* Cross-chain deployment audits
