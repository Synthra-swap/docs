# Protocol

This section provides a technical overview of the Synthra protocol, including its architecture, smart contracts, security measures, and audit information. Understanding these technical aspects is valuable for developers, integrators, and users who want to gain deeper insights into how Synthra works under the hood.

## What You'll Learn

* **Architecture**: The overall design of the Synthra protocol and how its components interact
* **Smart Contracts**: The core contracts that power Synthra and their functions
* **Security**: The security measures implemented to protect user funds and ensure protocol stability
* **Audits**: Information about security audits conducted on the Synthra protocol

## Protocol Design Philosophy

Synthra's protocol design is guided by several key principles:

### Capital Efficiency

The protocol is designed to maximize capital efficiency through concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their assets where they're most useful.

### Composability

Synthra is built to be highly composable, with a modular architecture that allows other protocols to easily integrate with and build on top of it.

### Security First

Security is a foundational principle, with multiple layers of protection, formal verification of critical components, and a conservative approach to protocol upgrades.

### Decentralization

The protocol is designed to operate in a trustless, permissionless manner, with governance distributed among token holders.

### Sustainability

The unique treasury fee mechanism ensures long-term sustainability by creating a steady funding source for protocol development and token buybacks.

## Technical Resources

For developers looking to build on or integrate with Synthra, we recommend exploring the [Developer Resources](../developers/) section after reviewing the protocol documentation.
