# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for Synthra Protocol, a decentralized exchange protocol designed for efficient trading with concentrated liquidity.

## What is Synthra?

Synthra is an innovative decentralized exchange protocol that introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their capital within custom price ranges. This approach significantly improves capital efficiency compared to traditional automated market makers.

The protocol features a unique treasury fee mechanism, where an additional 0.1% fee from each swap is directed to the protocol treasury. These funds are strategically used for token buybacks, enhancing the ecosystem's sustainability and value proposition.

## Key Features

* **Concentrated Liquidity**: Provide liquidity within specific price ranges for maximum capital efficiency
* **Multiple Fee Tiers**: Choose from various fee tiers based on expected pair volatility
* **Treasury Fee Mechanism**: 0.1% of all swap volumes are directed to the protocol treasury
* **Buyback Program**: Treasury funds are used for strategic token buybacks
* **Non-Custodial Trading**: Maintain full control of your assets while trading
* **Permissionless Pools**: Anyone can create new trading pairs
