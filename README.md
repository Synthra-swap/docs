# Synthra Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Synthra Protocol - the next-generation decentralized exchange designed for maximum capital efficiency and sustainable growth.

## What is Synthra?

Synthra is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange protocol that revolutionizes automated market making through concentrated liquidity positions. Liquidity providers can allocate their capital within custom price ranges, achieving up to 4000x greater capital efficiency compared to traditional AMMs.

### The Synthra Advantage

What sets Synthra apart is our innovative **treasury fee mechanism**. While liquidity providers receive 2/3 (67%) of trading fees, 1/3 (33%) is directed to the protocol treasury. This creates a sustainable revenue stream that funds:

- **Token Buyback Programs**: Consistent buying pressure supporting token value
- **Protocol Development**: Continuous innovation and feature enhancement  
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Strategic partnerships and integrations
- **Community Incentives**: Rewards for active participants

This model ensures long-term sustainability without relying on token emissions or diluting existing holders.

## Core Features
