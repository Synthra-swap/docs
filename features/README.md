# Synthra Features

This section covers the unique features and innovations that set Synthra apart from other decentralized exchanges. These features work together to create a sustainable and efficient trading ecosystem.

## Core Innovations

### üèõÔ∏è Treasury Fee Mechanism
Synthra's revolutionary **67/33 fee split** creates sustainable protocol revenue while maintaining competitive returns for liquidity providers.

- **67% to LPs**: Competitive yields for liquidity providers
- **33% to Treasury**: Funding for buybacks and development  
- **Self-Sustaining**: No reliance on token emissions or external funding
- **Transparent**: All treasury activities publicly visible

### üî• Token Buyback Program
Systematic token buybacks using treasury funds create consistent buying pressure and deflationary economics.

- **Regular Schedule**: Weekly buybacks with emergency provisions
- **Immediate Burning**: All purchased tokens permanently removed
- **Multi-DEX Execution**: Optimal pricing across venues
- **Transparent Reporting**: All activities publicly tracked

### üí∞ Sustainable Tokenomics
Carefully designed token economics that align incentives across all stakeholders without relying on unsustainable emissions.

- **Fixed Supply**: 100M tokens, no additional minting
- **Deflationary Pressure**: Regular burning reduces supply
- **Governance Rights**: Token holders control protocol direction
- **Utility Growth**: Expanding use cases for token holdings
